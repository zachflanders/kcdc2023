[Kiah Tolliver](https://github.com/KiahTolliver)
 - You need to be able to deploy your own code to be a fullstack developer

## What is DevOps
 - No silos, don't throw the code over the cubical wall and say "make this run."

### Core Principles
 - collaboration and communication
 - automation
 - ci/cd
 - IaC
 - Monitoring and Feedback
   - detect anomolies
   - provide feedback on metrics

### Benefits

## CI/CD

 - Maintain a single source repo
 - Automate build deploy process
 - Run tests
   - unit, integration, e2e
 - Use version control
 - The code cannot be deployed without passing tests
 - participate in code reviews

## Demo - Github Actions
